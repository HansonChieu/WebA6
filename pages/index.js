            The Metropolitan Museum of Art, colloquially &quot;the Met,&quot; is one of the world&apos;s largest and most
            prestigious art museums. Located in New York City, it was founded in 1870 and opened its doors
            in 1872. The museum&apos;s permanent collection contains over two million works, divided among 17
            curatorial departments.
